Tabby, whatever this is, it's real,

3
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,233
and we are stuck.

4
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:25,694
You're telling me I'm
in a town I can't leave

5
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:27,905
and that every night
monsters come from the forest.

00:00:29,438 --> 00:00:30,467
No! Aah!

00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:32,284
A man protects his family, Frank!

00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:33,702
Open your eyes and look!

00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:35,621

00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:41,043
And I wish you had the luxury
of grief, but you don't, Boyd.
